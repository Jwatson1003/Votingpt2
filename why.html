              <p>Without your vote, you leave the fate of the country to a small percent. A Democracy is only as good as the people who are in it. Don't leave the fate of our country in the hands of a couple million</p>

              <h2>Your Vote MATTERS</h2>
              <p> A common misconception for young voters is the idea that one vote won't change the election or my vote won't matter. This is a very dangerous mindset to have due to the fact that if everyone thinks that,  then no one ends up voting. If you're a blue voter in a red state or a red voter in a blue state voice your opinion, speak up let them know you are there and not afraid to fight for what you believe is right. Do not surrender your voice.</p>

              <h2>Local and State Elections Will Have a Direct Impact on your Community</h2>
              <p>Another fatal flaw of voting is the lack of participation at the local level. Presidential voting is extremlely important, but so are the local elections. Vote for mayors, school representatives, congressman, police, etc to solve issues that will directly impact your day to day.</p>

              <h2>THE FUTURE DEPENDS ON THE CHOICES MADE TODAY</h2>
              <p>Probably one of the most important reasons on this list. What we choose to do today will define the who we will be as a country for years to come. Wouldn't you wanna say in your future?</p>
